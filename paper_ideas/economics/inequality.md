Identifying the effect on inequality of automation.

## More than one sentence

Automation has the opportunity to both exacerbate and mitigate inequality.

Labour inequality will be exacerbated as middle-skill jobs are automated away, low-skill low-complementary jobs experience wage declines, and high-skill jobs will experience most complementarity. Capital inequality will decline as companies replace workers and increase profits; further, more capital has the potential to accumulate in smaller companies (e.g. tech companies, like Facebook or WhatsApp.) We may literally see more wealth going to the owners of robots and AI.

However, inequality may be lessened for a few reasons. First, the economy will grow and consumption will increase, and intensive tasks will increase, with potentially higher wages; with guided training, those at the bottom of the wealth spectrum should be able to command higher wages. Second, the barriers to entry for IT-intensive industries – a chunk of the economy that already encompasses 25% of output – are lower than almost any other industry, leading to broader capital ownership.

This paper would look at:

- What are the dynamics of automation-driven inequality likely to be?
- What might a government do about it?
