## One Sentence
An explanation of the industries that will grow to be a substantial part of the economy as a result of automation.

## Expansion

The optimist's view of automation is that the economy will *transition* – complementarity effects of technology will increase work and wages in certain areas of the economy. This has happened before: from crafts to factories; from agriculture to services. This time, it is likely that it will be in high-skilled professions, advanced manufacturing, the knowledge economy, and other technology-complementing and abstract-task-based industries.

This paper would look at:
- What specific industries will grow?
- How will wages, employment shares, and education change?
- How will existing industries change?
- Geographically, where will this happen?
- What should a government do about this?

I propose a special section to focus on machine learning. Economists often ignore it because it is not understood.
