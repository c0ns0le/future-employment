## One Sentence

This paper would attempt to do the accounting for how much of labour productivity & per capita income is due to post-2000 automation.

## Expansion

This is a dangerous contradiction to the standard theory that automation complements productivity. This exploration would argue why we have not seen the "automation bump" and attempt to account for how much automation _has_ contributed.
