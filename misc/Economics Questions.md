## Interesting Economics Questions

### Macroeconomics

* How does the economy react to automation, and will it be different *this* time (as opposed to the industrial or agricultural revolutions?)
* How will the wealth of automation be distributed?

### Labour Economics

* Are workers forced out of the labour force, or do they choose to leave?
* Do labourers retrain & reskill due to automation?
* What skills do new entrants enter with?
* Are there "social constructs" (Paul Krugman) that prevents automation?
* *Who*, across education & income & geographic discriminators, will be most automated?
* The traditional notion has been that the lower and upper tiers (non-routine physical, and non-routine non-physical work) of work will be the areas that automation will replace last. When will this happen?

### Innovation

* What new industries will be opened and created by innovation?
* What is the best proxy to measure the spread of a technology?
* What barriers in automation technologies do we face? Are they cost limits, or limits of physics?

### Automation

* How do you differentiate between augmenting and automating tools and technology?
* How do you define "automatability": Is it continuous or discrete? Is it probability of full automation, or proportion of the job that is automatable?
* How do you categorize jobs in terms of automatability? Do you use the 0.3 & 0.7 cutoffs? (As in the original paper.)
* Are the most "dangerous" tools the commonplace task-automators (like Microsoft Excel), or the step-change innovations, like surgical robots and self-driving cars?

### Public Economics

If you were in charge of a country, what changes would you make to:

  * Your education system, to ensure your population will have jobs
  * Your social security system, to support those who are automated away
  * Your tax code and business law, to ensure businesses can innovate and grow?
  * Your legal system, to address the ethical issues of the spread of technologies into new areas?
