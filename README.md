# Project Proposal

## Introduction

This proposal serves two purposes:
* To give a general sense of the problem at hand, the starting points for my work, and deliverables as a result.
* To provide a common file we can iterate upon.

This proposal is scoped for a 1-year project. This has been cleared with Mike. The reason why is because I have the possibility of doing the MSc in Neuroscience, which is in line with my longer-term objectives. If I decide, come early summer 2016, that I need to pursue the MSc, then I will submit a 1-year scoped research project in hopes of attaining the MSc in Engineering Science by research. *However*, if the research is an exceptionally strong research area, I would love to carry it forward into a DPhil. As of right now, my intention is to approach the research as if I were a DPhil student.

## Summary of Proposal

The focus of this research will be to evaluate the effect of technology on employment. Broadly, will technology replace employment, create employment, or change the nature of employment? Specifically, what technology and tools have become more important in the workforce over the preceding generations, and how does that change implicate certain professions and skills to be replaced?

Thus, this research likely involves (in order):
1. Mapping the change in tools, technology, and skills used in jobs
2. Breaking down jobs into their constituent human capital requirements
3. Classifying human capital requirements as "automatable"
4. Assessing how human capital requirements have been automated already
5. Combining #3 & #4 to create a granular report on how automatable certain jobs are
6. If #1 gives us insight into how fast & what types of jobs are being automated, we may also be able to identify *when* certain jobs will be fully or critically automated

## Specific Economics Sub-Questions

### Automation
* How do you define "automatability"
  * Is it continuous or discrete?
  * Is it probability of full automation, or proportion of job that is automatable?
* How do you categorize jobs in terms of automatability?
  * Do you use the 0.3 & 0.7 cutoffs?
* How do you match tools and technology in employment as automation, versus augmentation?

### Types of Labour
* Are workers forced out of the labour force, or do they choose to leave?
* Do people retrain & reskill due to automation?
* What skills do new entrants enter with?
* Are there "social constangructs" (Paul Krugman) that prevents automation?
* *Who*, across education & income & geographic discriminators, will be most automated?

### Theory questions
* How does the economy react to automation, and will it be different *this* time (as opposed to the industrial or agricultural revolutions?)
* Innovation will also *open and create* new sub-industries. Can we tell what those will be?

## Specific Technical Challenges to be solved
* Hierarchical nature of the data
* NLP – interpreting function or automation risk of technology from description

## Data to be Used
* O*Net Data

## Helpful Connections to People
* Access to the Martin School (key researchers, discussion groups or opportunities to discuss my research, events)
* Institute for New Economic Thinking – if there are events or chances to discuss, I'd love to be involved or introduced
  * Prof. J. Doyne Farmer – "Forecasting Technological Progress"
  * Prof. Robert Axtell, Dr. Omar Guerrero, Dr. Eduardo Lopez – "Labour Markets as Networks"
* Future of Humanity Institute
* Citigroup (?)

## Helpful Advice I'd like
* Specifically, what is the technical (mathematical/statistical) requirements for graduation? Can we develop a set of expectations and a learning plan for me?
* What are your expectations?
  * For all your graduate students, normally
  * For me in particular
* What resources (exams, past problem sets) can I use along the way to test my ability to understand and use GPs & related topics?
* What areas of Probability Theory & Machine Learning are most important to learn first?
* How can I have ample chance discuss or brainstorm my research with others, and who might those be? (I think best through conversation.)

## Other Notes
* I just wanted to note that to me, one of the most important aspects this project is the chance to learn and master related fields. In particular, I will be working on some specific theoretical & technical skills:
  * Gaussian processes
  * Bayesian statistics
  * Graph theory
  * Information theory
  * Numerical solutions to differential equations
  * Statistical mechanics
  * Machine Learning as used in neuroscience, genetics, and chemistry

  *if you see opportunities for me to involve this in my research, please let me know!*
* If Oxford & the Martin School is putting more energy into this research, what exactly does that look like?
* This research is notably "headline-worthy". As a result, I think there are productive thought pieces we, or I, could write, that could be small white papers in and of themselves:
    - What prescient governments ought to do now
    - How children of the future will grow up, or how they should grow up to be most valuable
    - What industries will be most improved through Artificial Intelligence?
    - What industries will be created by AI/ML/MR
    - What barriers in ML do we face, and what would the impact of breaking those barriers be?
