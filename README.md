# Project Proposal

## Introduction

This proposal serves two purposes:
* To give a general sense of the problem at hand, the starting points for my work, and deliverables as a result.
* To provide a common file we can iterate upon.

This proposal is scoped for a 1-year project. This has been cleared with Mike. The reason why is because I have the possibility of doing the MSc in Neuroscience, which is in line with my longer-term objectives. If I decide, come early summer 2016, that I need to pursue the MSc, then I will submit a 1-year scoped research project in hopes of attaining the MSc in Engineering Science by research. *However*, if the research is an exceptionally strong research area, I would love to carry it forward into a DPhil. As of right now, my intention is to approach the research as if I were a DPhil student.


## Summary of Proposal

The focus of this research will be to evaluate the effect of technology on employment. Broadly, will technology replace employment, create employment, or change the nature of employment? Specifically, what technology and tools have become more important in the workforce over the preceding generations, and how does that change implicate certain professions and skills to be replaced?

Thus, this research likely involves (in order):
1. Mapping the change in tools, technology, and skills used in jobs
2. Breaking down jobs into their constituent human capital requirements
3. Classifying human capital requirements as "automatable"
4. Assessing how human capital requirements have been automated already
5. Combining #3 & #4 to create a granular report on how automatable certain jobs are
6. If #1 gives us insight into how fast, what types, and how much of jobs are being automated, we may also be able to identify *when* certain jobs will be fully or critically automated

Once a reasonable "metric" has been achieved, the next steps are to generate insights based on the magnitude. This is an area I've committed less thought to right now but would enjoy fleshing this out with you.

While it's surely already clear to you why this work is both original and well-motivated, here are my general thoughts:
1. This is a recent phenomenon, and is little understood.
2. This is partly due to the lack of scientific researchers (though popular science books have been successful.) and partly due to econometric tools that are poorly suited for inference. (Thus relegating it to philosophy and popular science.)
3. This is important, as it will define the whole transition a developed economy will make in the near future, and also because it is an attempt to use interdisciplinary tools

## Specific Economics Sub-Questions

### Automation Questions
* How do you define "automatability"
  * Is it continuous or discrete?
  * Is it probability of full automation, or proportion of job that is automatable?
* How do you categorize jobs in terms of automatability?
  * Do you use the 0.3 & 0.7 cutoffs?
* How do you match tools and technology in employment as automation, versus augmentation?

### Labour Questions
* Are workers forced out of the labour force, or do they choose to leave?
* Do people retrain & reskill due to automation?
* What skills do new entrants enter with?
* Are there "social constructs" (Paul Krugman) that prevents automation?
* *Who*, across education & income & geographic discriminators, will be most automated?

### Theory Questions
* How does the economy react to automation, and will it be different *this* time (as opposed to the industrial or agricultural revolutions?)
* Innovation will also *open and create* new sub-industries. Can we tell what those will be?
* How will the benefits of this creative destruction be distributed?

## Specific Technical Challenges to be Solved
* Hierarchical nature of the O*Net data
* NLP – interpreting function or automation risk of technology from description
* Classifying occupations for technology use conditioned on skills
* Predictively classifying jobs susceptible to new technologies
* Income regression based on skills and technologies
* Measuring "social construct" resistance to technological replacement

## Data to be Used
* O*Net Data
* Employment numbers data (from original paper) (BLS)
* Income data by profession (not yet found)
* Technological development data (not yet found) – tracking technologies over time
* Patent data (potentially, as a proxy for technological development)

## Helpful Connections to People
* Access to the Martin School (key researchers, discussion groups or opportunities to discuss my research, events)
* Institute for New Economic Thinking – if there are events or chances to discuss, I'd love to be involved or introduced
  * Prof. J. Doyne Farmer – "Forecasting Technological Progress"
  * Prof. Robert Axtell, Dr. Omar Guerrero, Dr. Eduardo Lopez – "Labour Markets as Networks"
* Future of Humanity Institute
* Citigroup (?)

## Literature I Expect to be Reading
One of the most important aspects of this project is the chance to learn and master related fields. You'll note in the timeline that the first few months is not direct research but largely self-directed learning.
### Economics

#### Labour
* Search and replacement frictions
* Theory of human capital & complementarity

#### Macro
* Creative destruction (Schumpeter, Aghion & Howitt)
* Econometric forward-modelling of economies
* Capital theory in face of software

#### Public
* Government approaches to the burden of necessary, large social costs
* How governments approached transitions during the Industrial & Agricultural revolutions
* Development of market-making industries (like Uber)

### Machine Learning
#### Computer Science
* Functional programming  (for good measure)
* Automation Theory
* Algorithmic efficiency and complexity

#### Information Theory
* Complexity theory & Networks

#### Mathematics & Statistics
* Probability Theory
* Differential equations
* Optimization
* Signals
* Bayesian statistics
* Gaussian processes
* Statistical mechanics

# Questions I Have For You
1. Specifically, what is the technical (mathematical/statistical) requirements for transfering to a DPhil? Can we develop a set of expectations and a learning plan for me?
* What are your expectations?
  * For all your graduate students, normally
  * For me in particular
  * In terms of hours of work; publishing & quality of work; patterns you've seen from successful students in  the past.
* What areas of Probability Theory & Machine Learning are most important to learn first?
* How can I have ample chance discuss or brainstorm my research with others, and who might those be? (I think best through conversation.)
* What would 3 years of follow-on research look like?
* Would you like a chapter-by-chapter breakdown?
* If Oxford & the Martin School is putting more energy into this research. What exactly does that mean?
* This research is notably "headline-worthy". As a result, I think there are productive thought pieces we, or I, could write, that could be small white papers in and of themselves:
    - What prescient governments ought to do now
    - How children of the future will grow up, or how they should grow up to be most valuable
    - What industries will be most improved through Artificial Intelligence?
    - What industries will be created by AI/ML/MR
    - What barriers in ML do we face, and what would the impact of breaking those barriers be?
