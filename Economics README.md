# Research Proposal – Economics Theme

Logan Graham

## Introduction

This proposal serves two purposes:

* To elucidate the economics side of the project
* To explain the questions & literature I've been researching and I think are important to research

This proposal is scoped for a 1-year project. This has been cleared with Mike. The reason why is because I have the possibility of doing the MSc in Neuroscience, which is possibly in line with my longer-term objectives. If I decide, come early summer 2016, that I need to pursue the MSc, then I will submit a 1-year scoped research project in hopes of attaining the MSc in Engineering Science by research. *However*, if the research is an exceptionally strong research area, I would love to carry it forward into a DPhil. As of right now, my intention is to approach the research as if I were a DPhil student.

## Research Question

The initial research questions, prompted by Mike, seems to be:

> Which tools and technology will replace the most labour? Which tools and technology replace the most labour currently? How has this changed recently, and how do we track the emergence of important tools and technology over time? What is the bottom line contribution of tools and technologies to income?

I think it is important to discuss this with you to clarify that this is the right first step.

## Proposed Research Activities

### Tools and Technology

Using the O*NET database, I have begun to relate skills and tasks to tools and technologies that are employed. I will classify certain tools and technologies as "automating" tools and technologies. For verification, I will also use your previous measures of "automatable skills and tasks" and assign that classification to jobs.

Classifying tools, technology, and skills is subjective. Therefore, I plan to follow the approach you used in the original paper: classifying those that I am most certain about, then using a machine learning model to classify the rest. The idea is that the machine learning model will be able to identify patterns of automation that I am unable to.

I believe that this can be better accomplished using the full O\*NET database. The O\*NET database measures 38 separate employment characteristics, each with various measures, amounting to over 100mb of data. I believe that this can be fruitful for a first pass at the data, compared to the 9 parameters used in the original paper.

Important deliverables include:

1. A report on clusters of jobs that share similar technology automation characteristics. (That may reveal industries, skills, tasks, technology use that are importantly automatable.)
2. A summary which skills, tools, and technologies contribute the most to automation.

I am working on the above two now and expect to spend November doing so.

## Timeline

This is, right now, a very rough timeline. I would appreciate hearing how you expect a project like this to go.

| Date          | Theme           | Deliverable  |
| ------------- |:----------------|:----- |
| Nov 2015 | Engineering studies & Data Analysis       | First report: jobs & skills |
| Dec 2015 | Data Analysis      | First-term summary & next steps |
| Jan - Feb 2016 | Data "second-pass"      | First substantial results |
| Mar - May 2016 | Continuation    | Draft 1 |
| May - Jul 2016 | Evaluate continuation past year 1  | Further drafts |
| Aug 2016 |      | Final draft |
| Sep 2016 |   Finalize report    | Final hand-in |

## Learning Requirement – Engineering

Because I am within the Engineering Sciences division, a critical piece of my research has to be related to machine learning and computational statistics. Therefore, I expect that a lot of my time will also go into deepening my mastery of the probability, computer science, and mathematics. This involves (but isn't limited to):

* Taking courses (especially CDT courses) in computer science, statistics, and mathematics
* Completing assignments or projects designed to develop my expertise
* Attending seminars and presentations on these areas
* Reading books and using my own time to develop my competency

I always enjoy suggestions of interesting challenges in this area. This is particularly relevant if there are any big, nasty economics data sets that involve prediction, classification, and regression.

## Expectations as Your Supervisee

I would like to talk about what expectations you have of me – of the work I produce and the working relationship we have.

I am working with Mike to understand the specific Engineering Science expectations. I would like to know what a good economics end-product would look like. (Right now, I could guess it would look like a novel economic modelling/forecasting method, or a useful machine learning method applied to economics.)

By way of revealing more about me, I value:

* **Fluid communication**. Currently, I send Mike weekly email updates; I will email him or knock on his door whenever I have a question; we meet whenever one of us feels it is necessary.
* **Blunt feedback**. I value hearing what I can improve and what I am doing well.
* **Being challenged**. With new ideas, and on my ideas. I appreciate opportunities to debate, being passed events or seminars you think would be useful, or interesting people I should speak with.

**Managing Information**: Do you use any preferred information management systems? Currently, I use GitHub with Mike to manage all project files. If you use GitHub I can give you access. If not, we can work out another system.

## Literature I Expect to be Reading

I appreciate suggestions on authors, books, or works that you came across when producing your original paper. In the past, I have:

* Completed a thesis on labour economics and labour force dropout
* Read the popular books on the subject: *Average is Over*, *The Second Machine Age*, *Capital in the 21st Century*
* Studied and read most major growth models (I especially loved creative destruction) and read basic literature in labour theory
* Spent 3 months in Silicon Valley surrounded by robotics, AI, and "futurism" "experts"
* Launched a company that used novel technology to replace medical functions

### Labour
* Search and replacement frictions
* Theory of human capital, and complementarity with capital

### Macro
* History: economic transition due to the industrial and agricultural revolutions
* Creative destruction (Schumpeter, Aghion & Howitt)
* Econometric forward-modelling of economies
* Capital theory in face of software ("soft" capital)

### Public
* Government approaches to the burden of necessary, large social costs during economic transitions
* Development of industries through technology (like Uber)
* Fostering & protecting an innovation ecosystem

## Questions I have for you:
* It would be very useful to have access or affiliation to the Martin School (key researchers, discussion groups or opportunities to discuss my research, events). I don't need a workspace, but it would be great to use common tables to work.
* Whose research should I become familiar with? (I've identified J. Doyne Farmer and Robert Axtell et al at INET.)
* Future of Humanity Institute – Mike suggested I be in contact with them.
* What is Citigroup's involvement?
