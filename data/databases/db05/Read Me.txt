* In the 8.0 and earlier releases, the file Anchors.txt contained
information relevant to several different content areas. As of the 9.0
release, this information is now contained in three separate files:

  Level Scale Anchors.txt:
    This file contains the scale anchors for data elements rated on the
    Level scale; these variable, item-specific anchors are used in the
    data collection survey. It covers the Abilities, Knowledge, Skills,
    and Work Activities content areas.
  
  Education, Training, and Experience Categories.txt:
    This file contains the categories associated with scales in the
    Education, Training, and Experience content area. Categories are
    included for the Required Level of Education (RL), Related Work
    Experience (RW), On-Site or In-Plant Training (PT), and On-The-Job
    Training (OJ) scales.
  
  Work Context Categories.txt:
    This file contains the categories associated with scales in the
    Work Context content area. Categories are included for the Context
    (CXP) and Context Category (CTP) scales.
