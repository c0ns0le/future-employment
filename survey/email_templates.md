# To the committee/distributor

Hi ```$name_of_community_director```,

We are two researchers at the University of Oxford conducting research on the future of automation, employment, and work. I am emailing you in particular because we would like to ask how we might [distribute this survey]($link_to_survey) to your community members – we think might find it a very interesting one to complete.

Is it possible to pass on this opportunity to your community members through the mailing list? We think this is something they would benefit from. 

We are following up on our widely-discussed [2013 work that you may have seen](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/view/1314). We are asking you to use your knowledge of state-of-the-art technology to evaluate how automatable critical job tasks are. **Note: Is it good survey methodology to include this following statement?** Our aim is to provide a robust measure of automatability across the economy, in order to understand and predict the future automation of jobs and industries.

Please let me know how we might make this happen – I would be happy to discuss further, by email or phone, at your convenience!
