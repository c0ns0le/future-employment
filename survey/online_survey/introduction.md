Thank you for taking the time to answer this __~7 minute__ survey. 

We want to know how automatable certain tasks are. We are looking for your opinion:

<p style="text-align: center;">Do you believe or know that technology exists to automate these tasks?</p>

These definitions should guide you:

* __“Automatable”:__ a technology can complete a reasonable majority of the task.
	* A person may still be required to complete the task, but __most__ humans have been replaced by the technology.
* __“Automating Technology":__ technology (machine, software, process, etc.) that is either pre-commercial but proven, or commercial and purchasable.

You have four options:

1. Automatable
2. Automatable, with some simplification
3. Not Automatable
4. Unsure __<-- TODO: Create specific "unsure" responses__

To help you answer, we've provided two example questions for you below:

For example, when evaluating **Secretaries** with the task:
 
> Prepare invoices, reports, memos, letters, financial statements, and other documents, using word processing, spreadsheet, database, or presentation software.

You may believe that current technology such as business intelligence (BI) tools, financial dashboards, and automated report generators could completely automate this task if plugged into a company database.

Alternatively, when evaluating **Construction Carpenters** with the task:
 
> Shape or cut materials to specified measurements, using hand tools, machines, or power saws.

You may believe that this process, **with some simplification**, could be automated: for example, materials can currently be pre-fabricated and then transported to site, despite there not being a machine that is able to operate a hand tool.

All task questions are multiple choice.
