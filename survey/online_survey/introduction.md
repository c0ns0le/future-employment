Thank you for taking the time to answer this __~7 minute__ survey. 

We want to know how automatable certain tasks are. We are looking for your opinion:

__Do you believe or know that technology exists to automate these tasks?__

These definitions should guide you:

* __“Automatable”:__ a technology can acceptably complete a reasonable majority of the task.
	* A person may still be required to complete the task, but most humans have been replaced by the technology.
*__“Automating Technology":__ technology (machine, software, process, etc.) that is either pre-commercial but proven, or commercial and purchasable.

We've provided two examples for you below:
