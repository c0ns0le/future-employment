# Possible Incentives


## Non-Monetary

- A societal impact of filling out the survey
- The chance to understand how automatable your own occupation is
- The chance to see the survey results first
- The opportunity to be interviewed as a follow up
- A small white-paper on the automatability of a handful of jobs within the respondent's domain (receive once completed survey)
	- i.e. Robotics/ML/CS Researcher; Professor; Consultant


## Monetary
I personally don't think this will do much. I think we have a better chance with non-monetary incentives.

- #GBP/survey donated to a charity, up to a total of #GBP.
- #GBP pot donated to 3 charities; each participant votes for a % split between the three.
