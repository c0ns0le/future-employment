# To the committee/distributor

Dear ```$name_of_community_director```,

We are [two researchers](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/tech-employment/people) at the University of Oxford conducting research on the future of automation, employment, and work. I am emailing you in particular because we would like to ask how we might [distribute this survey]($link_to_survey) to your community members – we think they might find it a very interesting one to complete.

Is it possible to pass this opportunity on to your community members through your mailing list? If you decide to distribute this (or allow us too), we would also like to know, if possible, the size of your mailing list. We intend to use this data to measure the response rate.

For background, we are following up on our [2013 article that you may have seen](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/view/1314). We are asking you to use your knowledge of the state-of-the-art of technology to evaluate how automatable critical job tasks are. **Note: Is it good survey methodology to include this following statement?** Our aim is to provide a robust measure of automatability across the economy, in order to understand and predict the future automation of jobs and industries.

Please let me know how we might make this happen – I would be happy to discuss further, by email or phone, at your convenience!
